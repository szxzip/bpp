In 1966, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale started the BPP in Oakland, California. 

Black communities there faced **POVERTY**{style="color:#ff3030"}, police **VIOLENCE**{style="color:#ff3030"}, and **RACISM**{style="color:#ff3030"}. 

The BPP’s **TEN-POINT PROGRAM**{style="color:#ff3030"} demanded basic rights: fair housing, jobs, education, and an end to police brutality. 

They carried guns legally to patrol neighborhoods, protecting people from abusive cops. 

This was a bold move by **POOR BLACK WORKERS**{style="color:#ff3030"} to defend themselves against a system that ignored their needs.

By 1968, the BPP spread across the U.S. 

They mixed **SOCIALIST**{style="color:#ff3030"} ideas with Black pride, calling for revolution.

The FBI saw them as a threat and launched COINTELPRO—a secret program to **DESTORY**{style="color:#ff3030"} the group. 

Police raids, fake news, and lies split the party. 

In 1969, Chicago police **KILLED**{style="color:#ff3030"} Fred Hampton, a leader who united Black, white, and Latino poor communities. 

Meanwhile, the BPP’s survival programs—like free breakfast for kids and health clinics—showed how **WORKING-CLASS**{style="color:#ff3030"} people could help each other when the government failed them.

By the 1970s, the BPP weakened. 

**GOVENRMENT ATTACKS**{style="color:#ff3030"}, fights among leaders, and Newton’s **MISTAKES**{style="color:#ff3030"} hurt the party. 

But their legacy lives on. 

The BPP proved that fighting racism and capitalism must go **HAND IN HAND**{style="color:#ff3030"}. 

Their downfall also teaches us: without **UNITY**{style="color:#ff3030"} among all working people—Black, white, and others—real change is hard to achieve.

The BPP’s history teaches us two things:

- **SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION**{style="color:#ff3030"}: Racism and poverty are tools capitalism uses to divide workers.

- **PEOPLE’S POWER**{style="color:#ff3030"}: When communities organize, they can challenge unfair systems—even if the state fights back.

The Panthers’ fight reminds us that **JUSTICE**{style="color:#ff3030"} requires both **RESISTING**{style="color:#ff3030"} oppression and **BUILDING**{style="color:#ff3030"} world for all workers.
