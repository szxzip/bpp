In 1966, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale started the BPP in Oakland, California. 

Black communities there faced poverty, police violence, and racism. 

The BPP’s Ten-Point Program demanded basic rights: fair housing, jobs, education, and an end to police brutality. 

They carried guns legally to patrol neighborhoods, protecting people from abusive cops. 

This was a bold move by poor Black workers to defend themselves against a system that ignored their needs.

By 1968, the BPP spread across the U.S. 

They mixed socialist ideas with Black pride, calling for revolution.

The FBI saw them as a threat and launched COINTELPRO—a secret program to destroy the group. 

Police raids, fake news, and lies split the party. 

In 1969, Chicago police killed Fred Hampton, a leader who united Black, white, and Latino poor communities. 

Meanwhile, the BPP’s survival programs—like free breakfast for kids and health clinics—showed how working-class people could help each other when the government failed them.

By the 1970s, the BPP weakened. 

Government attacks, fights among leaders, and Newton’s mistakes hurt the party. 

But their legacy lives on. 

The BPP proved that fighting racism and capitalism must go hand in hand. 

Their downfall also teaches us: without unity among all working people—Black, white, and others—real change is hard to achieve.

# [Why It Matters Today]{style="color:#ff3030"}

<figure style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-left: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

The BPP’s history teaches us two things:

- Systemic Oppression: Racism and poverty are tools capitalism uses to divide workers.

- People’s Power: When communities organize, they can challenge unfair systems—even if the state fights back.

The Panthers’ fight reminds us that justice requires both resisting oppression and building a fairer world for all workers.
